# Transparancy & Security, because why not both.


## Why Not Both
Krystallyne Systems is a project development storing system for Luaily LLC,
operational since 2021, and now revamped. It prioritizes transparency in actions
while maintaining stealthy security, ensuring the encryption methods are unknown
to outsiders to  prevent hacking. The system stores projects like Mountain, TAR,
Kappy, ExZero, ExPy, PyStealth, and TarLynk. Write Protection is ENABLED while
the fingerprint module is disabled, all transactions are synced and visible,
every file, every hash, every timestamp, logged 24/7.

The only two possible flaws are:
1. Physical Flaws - *Someone comes and gets the drives and reconstructs the data.*
2. Biometric Flaws - *Someone clones [@piieboi](https://github.com/piieboi) and then uses his fingerprint to unlock it.*

Transparancy -> "Data Transactions"
Security -> "Data Contents"
```
